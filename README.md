## Assignment 1 : Create a Lexical Analyzer for RAT21F.
---------------------------------------------------------
Created a lexer that recognizes identifiers, integers, reals, separators, operators, and comments for the programming language RAT21F created by Professor Choi at CSUF.
The lexer was developed by using a 2D array that acted as a finite state machine (FSM) to control the logic flow of recognizing tokens.
Arrays were also used to store a list of keywords and a list of separators.
